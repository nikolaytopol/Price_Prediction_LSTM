# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Introduction
This project aims to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that excels in capturing temporal dependencies in time-series data, making it ideal for financial analysis tasks like stock price forecasting.

## Understanding LSTM
LSTMs are designed for sequential data analysis, capable of handling long-term dependencies by learning what to retain, forget, and output through time, which proves beneficial in modeling time-series data.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Fetch historical stock data for a company (e.g., Apple from Yahoo Finance), including open, high, low, close prices, and volume.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Clean and normalize the data, removing unnecessary columns and scaling features.
- Prepare sequences of data to serve as input-output pairs for the model.

### Step 3: Model Architecture
- Utilize TensorFlow/Keras to design the LSTM model, specifying layers, units, and activation functions.

### Step 4: Data Splitting
- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to prepare for model training.

### Step 5: Model Compilation and Training
- Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
- Train the model, adjusting batch size and epochs as needed.

### Step 6: Model Evaluation
- Assess the model's performance using metrics like MAE or RMSE on the test data.

### Step 7: Prediction and Visualization
- Predict future stock prices with the trained model.
- Visualize comparison of actual vs. predicted prices.

### Step 8: Fine-Tuning and Optimization
- Experiment with hyperparameters and perform tuning to enhance model accuracy.

### Step 9: Conclusion
- Discuss the LSTM model's effectiveness in stock price prediction, acknowledging its potential and limitations.

## Note
LSTM models offer valuable insights into stock price trends, yet the stock market's complexity necessitates cautious interpretation of predictions for investment decisions.
